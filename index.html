                <p>Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page and Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them. Today's “best practices” lead to dead ends;
                    the best paths are new and untried.</p>

                <h2>About <span class="mission-color">Me</span></h2>
                <p> Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.  Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like the country's peace, I like metropolis noise;. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
                But my dream is still alive.</p>
